## Description
YesNote is an iOS app that I helped develop for my Capstone project at Kent State University. 

<blockquote>
  It is a jazz improvisation framework tool that provides a structured, yet open approach to learning improv fundamentals outside the classroom
</blockquote>

## Development

The app was completed:
- entirely in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
- within 2 months
- by a 6 man team.

We finished YesNote on schedule and delivered a polished, fully funtional application, complete with supporting documentation.



## UI / Features

Our main goal when designing the UI was to reduce clutter and menu overhead. 

It features 3 main interactions and popovers that allow the user to have exact control over each module.

## Usage 

YesNote is minimal, but *in all the right ways.*

Our application provides all the information needed to have a structured practice session in the palm of your hand. 


<blockquote>
Based on your initial chord and mode selection, it returns a scale that is consanant and corresponds musically. Within this scale, it  highlights the root notes and the perfect fifth. Then, it generates a backing chord as a set of modifiable notes. Finally, it allows you to enable a metronome that can also keep time to popular, lead-instrument jazz rhythms.
</blockquote>

The summation of these features is a structured framework for jazz improvisation that is content-rich, accessible and complete.
